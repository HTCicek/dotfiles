# Environment Variables
# =====================
  # Library Paths
  # These variables tell your shell where they can find certain
  # required libraries so other programs can reliably call the variable name
  # instead of a hardcoded path.

    # NODE_PATH
    # Node Path from Homebrew I believe
    export NODE_PATH="/usr/local/lib/node_modules:$NODE_PATH"

    # Those NODE & Python Paths won't break anything even if you
    # don't have NODE or Python installed. Eventually you will and
    # then you don't have to update your bash_profile

  # Configurations

    # GIT_MERGE_AUTO_EDIT
    # This variable configures git to not require a message when you merge.
    export GIT_MERGE_AUTOEDIT='no'

    # Editors
    # Tells your shell that when a program requires various editors, use sublime.
    # The -w flag tells your shell to wait until sublime exits -- changes all "atom" to "code"
    export VISUAL="code"
    export SVN_EDITOR="code"
    export GIT_EDITOR="code"
    export EDITOR="code"

    # Version
    # What version of the Flatiron School bash profile this is
    export FLATIRON_VERSION='1.1.1'

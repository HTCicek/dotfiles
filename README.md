##Dotfiles for my personal dev enviornment during FIS

###Installation
DESCRIBE INSTALL PROCESS

####Dotfiles
- ```bashdot install default``` to install contents of 'default' profile from dotfiles directory















###To do
- Write comprehensive Brewfile
    - Sort out which are casks and be safely automated
- Edit mac os initialization scripts when you've got a chance
- Should probably do a single shell script to automate the macos, xlinetools, brew etc.
